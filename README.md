# ECE 355: Microprocessor-Based Systems

## Course Objectives
Students will learn about hardware-software interplay and tradeoffs arising in modern embedded systems and associated system integration and interfacing issues.

## Learning Outcomes

* Use a modern 32-bit microcontroller development system to interface with multiple I/O devices
* Demonstrate communications skills though a lab report documenting project work carried out on a modern 32 bit microcontroller development system
* Use C programming language to write sample I/O interfacte software using polling and interrupts
* Apply key concepts pertaining to cache and virtual memory organization and operation
* Schedule real-time tasks using rate-monotonic earlieist-deadline first prioritization
* Analyze simple examples of instruction-level parallelism involving pipeline hazards
* Carry out IEEE-standardized floating-point arithmetic operations and format conversions
* Show and analyze logic interface circuits implementing simple bus protocols
